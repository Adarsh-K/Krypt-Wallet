Built a responsive web3 application to transfer Ethereum from one wallet to another. User can transfer Ethereum from their wallet to another address along with a message & a GIF which is fetched using Giphy API. It also shows all the user's transaction along with the GIFs & messages.

Website is built using React.js & TailwindCSS which connects to user's Ethereum wallet using Metamask. Contracts are written in Solidity and tested & deployed using Hard Hat.

### Note: The navbar is just a placeholder, so its buttons won't work.
